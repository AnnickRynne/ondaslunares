Click [here]() to access the live project.

This website is designed for a small start-up construction company based in Palmela Village, 30 minutes south of Lisbon, Portugal. The company was created in December 2022. The plan is to build small villas and sell them as holiday homes or permanent homes.

## B. Design

1. Colour Scheme
    
2. Typography

     The chosen font for this site is Work Sans. It looks elegant and easy to read. It works well on this one page site: [Linehan Construction & Restoration](https://architects.linehanconstruction.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAlMCOBhCZARIsANLid6Ze4Z-QJrfD01P0NZ2F8L2rwN5KyqBbYHwgyPJ2bXREqr5H2X0VJ70aAsqmEALw_wcB). The fallback font is Sans Serif (Work Sans being 'sans' serif).
   
3. Imagery

   The visitors to a construction website will expect to see photos of the finished products. As the construction is in progress, I use photos of similar completed projects, plans for the current project and images created by an interior designer (staging technic).
