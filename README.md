# INTRODUCTION
This website is designed for a small start-up construction company based in Palmela Village, a holiday resort located 30 minutes south of Lisbon, Portugal. The construction of the resort was interrupted in 2010 during the crash. Several developers are now investing in the resort, as there is a severe shortage of affordable housing in Lisbon. The company Ondas Lunares was created in December 2021. Their first project is to build approximately 15 villas.

## Design

I looked at various architects websites for inspiration regarding layout, content, style... and found the sites below very inspiring:
-  [Linehan Construction & Restoration](https://architects.linehanconstruction.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAlMCOBhCZARIsANLid6Ze4Z-QJrfD01P0NZ2F8L2rwN5KyqBbYHwgyPJ2bXREqr5H2X0VJ70aAsqmEALw_wcB)
- [Wallnut](https://www.wallnut.pt/)


1. Colour Scheme

    The name of the company means "moon waves". I looked at some online moonlight photos and  paintings that inspired me to use shades of blue, ochre and off-white (like here: ["Pleine-lune"](https://quilteuseforever.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/pleine-lune.jpg)). I picked 3 colours: dark-slate-gray, sienna, linen.
    However, I had to replace the 'peru' colour by a darker shade to pass the accessibility requirements.

2. Typography

     The chosen font for this site is Work Sans. It looks elegant and easy to read. It works well on the Linehan Construction & Restoration website. The fallback font is Sans Serif (Work Sans being 'sans' serif.
   
3. Imagery

   The visitors to a construction website will expect to see photos of the finished products. As the construction is in progress, I use photos of similar completed projects, plans for the current project and images created by an interior designer (staging technic). 

## Wireframes

I chose to do a one-page website for the following reasons: 
The site is for a two-people startup company. In addition, builders don't need to provide tons of information online. Therefore, there is no need for multiple pages. Finally, a one-page website will be easy to maintain, simple to navigate and will offer a better mobile experience.

I made this decision after reading *"Website Battles: One-Page Website vs Multi-Page Website"* on [web.com](https://www.web.com/blog/start/website-design/website-battles--one-page-website-vs-multi-page-website) and *"How to Create a Beautiful One-Page Website"* on [wix.com](https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/08/how-to-create-one-page-website?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=9852964004^99403845119&experiment_id=^^433253293178^^_DSA&gclid=CjwKCAiA5t-OBhByEiwAhR-hm0JnFmcGlCjQBKoKQjyMFUJRnhZNgvEV_JOvAU0QFNWiuiDZP3zz4BoCx-8QAvD_BwE).
