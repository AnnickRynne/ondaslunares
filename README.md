# INTRODUCTION
This website is designed for a small start-up construction company based in Palmela Village, a holiday resort located 30 minutes south of Lisbon, Portugal. The construction of the resort was interrupted in 2010 during the crash. Several developers are now investing in the resort, as there is a severe shortage of affordable housing in Lisbon. The company Ondas Lunares was created in December 2022. Their first project is to build approximately 15 villas.

# I- USER EXPERIENCE (UX)
The target audience: Mainly, individuals who wish to buy a new-built villa, to use as a holiday home or a permanent home, but also people who sell villas (estate agents, investors...).

## A. User Stories
1. First Time Visitor Goals

   - As a potential client, I want to navigate the site easily 
   - I want to know what services the company offers


2. Returning Visitor Goals

   - I want visuals and a description of the current projects (plans, staging images, photos)
   - I want to find the Ondas Lunares contact details
   - I can request further information by mail or phone

3. Frequent User Goals

   - I expect to see updates (mostly, visuals) on the progress of the current construction project(s)


## B. Design

1. Colour Scheme
    The name of the company means "moon waves". I looked at some online moonlight photos and  paintings that inspired me to use shades of blue and ochre (like here: ["Pleine-lune"](https://quilteuseforever.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/pleine-lune.jpg)). Lisbon is near the sea and the land is mostly sand, so I think that the colours will go well with the photos of the area, which is very dry in the summer.

2. Typography

     The chosen font for this site is Work Sans. It looks elegant and easy to read. It works well on this one page site: [Linehan Construction & Restoration](https://architects.linehanconstruction.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAlMCOBhCZARIsANLid6Ze4Z-QJrfD01P0NZ2F8L2rwN5KyqBbYHwgyPJ2bXREqr5H2X0VJ70aAsqmEALw_wcB). The fallback font is Sans Serif (Work Sans being 'sans' serif).
   
3. Imagery

   The visitors to a construction website will expect to see photos of the finished products. As the construction is in progress, I use photos of similar completed projects, plans for the current project and images created by an interior designer (staging technic). 

## C. Wireframes

I chose to do a one-page website for the following reasons: 
The site is for a two-people startup company. In addition, builders don't need to provide tons of information online. Therefore, there is no need for multiple pages. Finally, a one-page website will be easy to maintain, simple to navigate and will offer a better mobile experience.

I made this decision after reading *"Website Battles: One-Page Website vs Multi-Page Website"* on [web.com](https://www.web.com/blog/start/website-design/website-battles--one-page-website-vs-multi-page-website) and *"How to Create a Beautiful One-Page Website"* on [wix.com](https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/08/how-to-create-one-page-website?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=9852964004^99403845119&experiment_id=^^433253293178^^_DSA&gclid=CjwKCAiA5t-OBhByEiwAhR-hm0JnFmcGlCjQBKoKQjyMFUJRnhZNgvEV_JOvAU0QFNWiuiDZP3zz4BoCx-8QAvD_BwE).
