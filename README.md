# INTRODUCTION
This website is designed for a small start-up construction company based in Palmela Village, a holiday resort located 30 minutes south of Lisbon, Portugal. The construction of the resort was interrupted in 2010 during the crash. Several developers are now investing in the resort, as there is a severe shortage of affordable housing in Lisbon. The company Ondas Lunares was created in December 2021. Their first project is to build approximately 15 villas.

## Design

I looked at various architects websites for inspiration regarding layout, content, style... and found the sites below very inspiring:
-  [Linehan Construction & Restoration](https://architects.linehanconstruction.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAlMCOBhCZARIsANLid6Ze4Z-QJrfD01P0NZ2F8L2rwN5KyqBbYHwgyPJ2bXREqr5H2X0VJ70aAsqmEALw_wcB)
- [Wallnut](https://www.wallnut.pt/)


1. Colour Scheme

    The name of the company means "moon waves". I looked at some online moonlight photos and  paintings that inspired me to use shades of blue, ochre and off-white (like here: ["Pleine-lune"](https://quilteuseforever.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/pleine-lune.jpg)). I picked 3 colours: dark-slate-gray, sienna, linen.
    However, I had to replace the 'peru' colour by a darker shade to pass the accessibility requirements.

 </div>

2. Typography

     The chosen font for this site is Work Sans. It looks elegant and easy to read. It works well on the Linehan Construction & Restoration website. The fallback font is Sans Serif (Work Sans being 'sans' serif.
   
3. Imagery

   The visitors to a construction website will expect to see photos of the finished products. As the construction is in progress, I use photos of similar completed projects, plans for the current project and images created by an interior designer (staging technic). 

## Wireframes

I chose to do a one-page website for the following reasons: 
The site is for a two-people startup company. In addition, builders don't need to provide tons of information online. Therefore, there is no need for multiple pages. Finally, a one-page website will be easy to maintain, simple to navigate and will offer a better mobile experience.

I made this decision after reading *"Website Battles: One-Page Website vs Multi-Page Website"* on [web.com](https://www.web.com/blog/start/website-design/website-battles--one-page-website-vs-multi-page-website) and *"How to Create a Beautiful One-Page Website"* on [wix.com](https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/08/how-to-create-one-page-website?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=9852964004^99403845119&experiment_id=^^433253293178^^_DSA&gclid=CjwKCAiA5t-OBhByEiwAhR-hm0JnFmcGlCjQBKoKQjyMFUJRnhZNgvEV_JOvAU0QFNWiuiDZP3zz4BoCx-8QAvD_BwE).

# FEATURES
The website is to inform potential buyers about the construction of new villas at Palmela Village. The buyers are most likely to be Lisbon commuters, investors, holiday makers. 

## Header
The logo, in the top left corner, is the name of the company. It's just text at the moment. The navigation menu, on the right, is short enough to be seen on small devices. I chose a fixed position for the header for a good visibility and convenience.
 <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="docs/navbar.png" alt="horizontal navigation bar with 4 links"></div>

## Palmela Village
The hero image contains a centered heading which should catch the attention. It is unlikely that visitors will know much about the place itself however. I first present what is attractive about the area on the landing page, under the hero image. The hero image itself suggests that the village is in the countryside and the villas are modern. 

 <div style="text-align: center;">
 <img src="docs/landing.png" alt="hero image and Palmela Village section">
</div>

## Project
Assuming that the visitor likes the area, he/she will scroll down or navigate to the 'project section'. It's a basic layout of the V2 model villa to be built. To visualize the rooms, 5 mokeups have been added below the layout section.

 <div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

## Team
Showing photos and giving some information on the people who run the company and the staff inspires confidence; it is a common feature on most construction/architects websites.

## Get in Touch
A potential buyer might want to receive more information, wish to speak to someone or visit Palmela village. This section should cover it.

# TESTING
The validators below were used to check the errors and warnings. I had 1 error and 1 warning. The html code I copied from Google Map to display a map in my Get in Touch section was obsolete. I had to fix it by using CSS code. I also had to replace each h1 at the top of each section by h2 headings. The only remaining h1 being used is the Ondes Lunares logo.

The website was successfully tested on Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari, using 2 mobile phones (Lenovo P2a42 V7.0 and Poco MIUI 12, a DELL laptop and an Ipad Pro 10.5". 

# ACCESSIBILITY
I use the WAVE chrome extension to test accessibility. It first showed 7 contrast errors. This was fixed by changing a color (see my comments under "Design").
