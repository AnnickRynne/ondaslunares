            <h2>Great location</h2>
            <p>Palmela Village is a touristic development located in Quinta do Anjo,
                40 km South of Lisbon, in the district of Setúbal, a dynamic coastal town.
                It is served by excellent infrastructure and benefits from the proximity of the Castles of Palmela,
                great beaches (9 km away) and the beautiful landscapes of the Serra da Arrábida Natural Park.
                It is closed to all the amenities you can wish for.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pal_div">
            <h2>Safe environment</h2>
            <p>The housing development is fenced, with security-controlled entrance and exit points.
                It is integrated in a landscaped park, which offers plenty of opportunities for exercise or casual
                walks, in one of the most beautiful natural areas on the coast of Lisbon.
                There is a communal outdoor swimming pool and a fine restaurant on site.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pal_div">
            <h2>Modern architecture</h2>
            <p>The architecture is very contemporary, with clean modern lines, a variety of forms and a mix of
                white and vibrant colours on external accent walls. The properties are diverse, ranging from small
                studios to luxury villas. At Ondas Lunares, we offer to build 2 bedroomed villas.</p>
